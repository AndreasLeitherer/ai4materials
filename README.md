Welcome to ai4materials's README
========================================


ai4materials allows to perform complex machine learning and compressed sensing modeling of materials science data. It also
provide functions to pre-process (on parallel processors), save and subsequently load materials science datasets,
thus easing the traceability, reproduciblity, and prototyping of new models.
