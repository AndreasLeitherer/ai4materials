Welcome to ai4materials's documentation!
====================================

ai4materials allows to perform complex machine learning and compressed sensing modeling of materials science data. It also
provide functions to preprocess (on parallel processors), save and subsequently load materials science datasets,
thus easing the traceability, reproduciblity, and prototyping of new models.

On the side panel, you can find a few examples that showcase what ai4materials can do.

Finally, with ai4materials you can reproduce results from the following publications:
