This folder contains the mutual information for Fig. 4c, ordered according to the strided pattern matching positions as provided by the indicated pickle files.
For all structures (geometry files are deposited in the folder for Fig. 4), a stride of 1A is chosen in all directions alongside a box of 12 A, and a padding of [1.0, 1.0, 1.0]. 
These parameters allow to obtain the geometries corresponding to the prediction in the "results.csv" file using the "get_boxes_from_xyz" function in ai4materials/utils/utils_crystals.py
