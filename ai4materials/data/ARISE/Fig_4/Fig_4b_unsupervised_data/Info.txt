Two pickle files containing the strided pattern positions are contained, one for the total, unfiltered data, and another one containing only those that are assigned the L!0 prototype (via ARISE). 

Moreover, cluster labels and embeddings can be extracted via the pickle files which contain the cluster and projection objects.
