## Data for ARISE: Crystal-structure recognition via Bayesian deep learning
=============================================================================

This folder contains all the relevant data to reproduce the results of 

    A. Leitherer, A. Ziletti, and L.M. Ghiringhelli,
    Robust recognition and exploratory analysis of crystal structures via Bayesian deep learning, arXiv:2103.09777 (2021)

Besides uniquely named folders corresponding to the main figures, also the neural-network data (training and test set, model h5 file, training geometry files) are provided.

In addition, in each folder, corresponding to each main figure, an Info.txt file is placed that explains the contained data.

Besides data for the main figure, also geometry files of the Bain path and other AFLOW prototypes (used for testing ARISE's out-of-sample predictions) are specified (see also the Supplementary Information of the paper).
